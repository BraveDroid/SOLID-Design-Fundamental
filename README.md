# SOLID-Design-Fundamental
This is project that gives you a **solid** understanding of the **SOLID** Oriented Object Design principles using problem/solution approach and best practices.

I want to thank for _Robert C. Martin_, _Allen Holub_, _Gary McLean Hall_, _Donn Felker_ and everyone who shared his knowledge to help the large community of programmers via books, training videos, blog articles,
and whatever could help a programmer to write a solid object oriented code with confidence.
