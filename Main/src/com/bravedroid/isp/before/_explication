The problem is that if AnaloguePhone want only to use the dial method. And by adding it the other dependencies
we will get some unneeded coupling, and every time we change the code of this MultiPhone interface we have to compile then test
the other classes that uses it. The problem is that we will add an unecessary work for the AnaloguePhone.
