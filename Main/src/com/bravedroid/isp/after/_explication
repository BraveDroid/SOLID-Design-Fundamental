The solution is based on splitting the fat interface into many interfaces based only on needed behavior by the implementer to those interfaces.
So in one hand we can say that the SmartPhone has the type of Calculator as  it will make some calculating operations, it has also the type Phone as it wil dial()
 and finally it can also do the lightOn/off() so it has the type of a Flashlight.
In the other hand the AnaloguePhone does not have the type of Calculator nor Flashlight, it just hase the type of Phone.
So it would only depend on this type, and this is the interface segregation principle.
