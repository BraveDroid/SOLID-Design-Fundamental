The solution is based on making all the subTypes of the Phone Type do behave as they should be.
The behavior is about to dial so every phone have to dial with its way of doing this behavior.

The solution is based also on the principle that you should not ask for information but instead you should ask for help,
this also will let the SmartManager hide its methods unlock() and isLocked() and keep them private.

The solution is based on making SmartManager handle its problem internally to be able to do the dial() behavior.
