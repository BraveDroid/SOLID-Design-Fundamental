The problem come from hidden dependencies, we don't want to have some hidden dependencies.
We always want to let the calling class create the dependency instead of letting the class itself to create the dependency.

So how to create dependencies the right way with respecting the good direction?
and how to not depend on concrete modules?
We know that it is not not possible to create a program that have no concrete modules because in oop
to create a module you have to use the "new" keyword with a concrete class/module
so how to limit all these concrete modules?

We should use the power oo programming which is:
the ability, through the use of polymorphism, to gain absolute control over every source code dependency in the system.
